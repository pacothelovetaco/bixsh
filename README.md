# Bixsh
Bixsby is a terminal emulator that you can chat with. He's sort of like Siri but for developers and system administrators. This is the repo for Bixsh, a terminal emulator and client for Bixsby. Once installed, you can use Bixsby as a regular shell. You can issue terminal commands or just ask him a question. He is a chatterbox with lots to say.

## Installation

Bixby requires Ruby 2+

  1. Setup and run the Bixsby server: https://github.com/pacothelovetaco/bixsby
  2. Download the source code and expand the files into any directory of your choosing.
  3. Add `bixsh/bin` to your $PATH or cd into the folder and execute `ruby bin/bixsh -s SERVER_IP`

## Disclaimer
Bixsby is a work in progress and has many moving parts. He is meant to be my learning experiment. He also uses an AIML parser that I've developed called ProgramB. It's also still a work in progress. With that said, expect Bixsby to have some quirks. Please be patient with him, he's still learning.
